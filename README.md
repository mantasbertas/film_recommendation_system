# film_recommendation_system
Final project for dataml courses

Hybrid film recommendation system:
1 popularity based
2 colab filtering - item based
3 colab filtering - user based
4 user genre similarity based

all fed into a neural network to make final prediction for the user.

Still to do:
1) Create a UI (streamlit or tkinter) - done
2) Add scraping function to the main recommendation function so user only needs to provide IMDb user URL - done
